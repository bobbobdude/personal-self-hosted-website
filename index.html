    Hey! I'm Tom, a developer that lives in Stockholm. I've made projects in
    Rust, Python and Javascript but I would consider Java my speciality.
  </p>
  <p>Some of my projects include...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A cache simulator using Rust with Valgrind trace files!</li>
    <li>
      A group project where we created custom path finding algorithms using
      Java!
    </li>
    <li>
      A custom, user configurable chess game that just about functions in
      Python!
    </li>
    <li>
      This website is hosted on a Raspberry Pi that I set up myself, your
      computer is connected to something inside my apartment right now! Take
      that AWS. Read about the process on my GitHub repo
      <a href="https://github.com/bobbobdude/personal-self-hosted-website"
        >here</a
      >!
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    And many, many more! Also massive thanks to Idun who is simply the best.
